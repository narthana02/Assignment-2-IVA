# Assignment-2-IVA
Lab Task 1: Setup and Basic Extraction 
Objective: 
Install the necessary tools and libraries, and extract frame information from a video. 
Steps: 
1. Install ffmpeg and ffmpeg-python: 
o Install the ffmpeg tool and the ffmpeg-python library. 
2. Extract Frame Information: 
o Extract frame information from a sample video. 
Lab Task 2: Frame Type Analysis 
Objective: 
Analyze the extracted frame information to understand the distribution of I, P, and B frames 
in a video. 
Steps: 
1. Modify the Script: 
o Count the number of I, P, and B frames. 
o Calculate the percentage of each frame type in the video. 
2. Analyze Frame Distribution: 
o Plot the distribution of frame types using a library like matplotlib. 
o Plot a pie chart or bar graph showing the distribution of frame types using 
matplotlib. 
Lab Task 3: Visualizing Frames 
Objective: 
Extract actual frames from the video and display them using Python. 
Steps: 
1. Extract Frames: 
o Use ffmpeg to extract individual I, P, and B frames from the video. 
o Save these frames as image files. 
2. Display Frames: 
o Use a library like PIL (Pillow) or opencv-python to display the extracted 
frames. 
Tasks: 
1. Save I, P, and B frames as separate image files using ffmpeg. 
2. Use PIL or opencv-python to load and display these frames in a Python script. 
3. Compare the visual quality of I, P, and B frames. 
Lab Task 4: Frame Compression Analysis 
Objective: 
Analyze the compression efficiency of I, P, and B frames. 
Steps: 
1. Calculate Frame Sizes: 
o Calculate the file sizes of extracted I, P, and B frames. 
o Compare the average file sizes of each frame type. 
2. Compression Efficiency: 
o Discuss the role of each frame type in video compression. 
o Analyze why P and B frames are generally smaller than I frames. 
Lab Task 5: Advanced Frame Extraction 
Objective: 
Extract frames from a video and reconstruct a part of the video using only I frames. 
Steps: 
1. Extract and Save I Frames: 
o Extract I frames from the video and save them as separate image files. 
2. Reconstruct Video: 
o Use the extracted I frames to reconstruct a portion of the video. 
o Create a new video using these I frames with a reduced frame rate.
